# Finding Ori - Locating the origin of replication in bacterial genomes
## Background
Before a bacterial cell divides into two, it needs to create two copies of its DNA (one for each of the resulting daughter cells). DNA replication creates a new copy of the bacterial genome by using the original DNA strands as templates. **DNA polymerase** attaches to a template strand of DNA and syntheises a reverse complement strand (an anti-parallel strand of DNA with complementary bases). DNA polymerase binds to the replication origin of the circular genome (aka. **the *ori* region**).
